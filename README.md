# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Accessibility Features

This web application is built with accessibility in mind:

- Keyboard navigation support throughout the application
- ARIA attributes for improved screen reader compatibility
- Sufficient color contrast for text and interactive elements
- Form elements with proper labels
- Focus management for interactive elements
- Responsive design that works at different zoom levels

### Accessibility Testing

To check for accessibility issues:

1. Run `npm run lint:a11y` to perform static code analysis for accessibility issues
2. Use browser extensions like axe DevTools to test the running application
3. Test with screen readers (VoiceOver, NVDA, JAWS)
4. Navigate the app using only the keyboard to ensure full functionality

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Member Login (Demo Paywall)

The app now includes a minimal authentication gate. Set a password using an environment variable before running or building the app:

```bash
export REACT_APP_PASSWORD=yourSecret
npm start
```

Deployments (e.g., Netlify) should also define `REACT_APP_PASSWORD`. Users must enter this password to access the app. Replace this with a real authentication and payment system (like Netlify Identity + Stripe) when you are ready to charge for access.


### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
